# Implementation audit — 9 October 2026

## Latest edition — mobile identity and GitHub Pages readiness

The root site is independent of the previous application. The archive was permanently deleted at the user's request after the 14-image asset integrity check passed. With that folder absent, root asset preparation, type checking, production builds and the final browser suites all passed. Older sections below record earlier editions and measurements.

The creative concept remains **The everyday, considered.** Exactly one product-led signature remains: **A closer look**, an explicit reversible angle/front inspection with two artwork annotations, an immediate reduced-motion alternative, and a static prerendered view. The compatible design direction is high-end-visual-design's editorial luxury; GSAP/ScrollTrigger and desktop-only Lenis remain the motion stack. No Three.js runtime or additional signature was introduced.

### Changed files and assets

- Navigation.tsx and styles.css replace the divided live-text branding with assets/brand/nurture-wordmark.svg, an authored seven-letter outlined wordmark, above a smaller flat espresso TRAYN Nutrition adaptation. brand/create-wordmark.py preserves its native generation source; the locally licensed Cormorant font remains in assets/fonts/. The flat TRAYN master and lossless WebP delivery also live in assets/brand/.
- Hero.tsx, product.ts and prepare-media.mjs add two newly generated phone masters and four 360/720px deliveries under assets/. Picture sources choose them below 760px. The mobile product is larger, the exploration link precedes it, reading sizes and touch targets improve, and the complete endorsement remains at 320px. A compact coarse-pointer landscape composition keeps the primary action within the first screen.
- ProductGallery.tsx defers the closed lightbox's full-size image. Its image is explicitly decoded and checked after opening in the production/cross-browser suites. index.html, main.tsx and styles.css reserve the mobile header while hydration loads and restore native navigation on module-load failure. The inspection control reserves its loading-label width.
- social-preview.mjs and assets/social/social-preview.jpg adopt the new lockup. Exact raster prompts/input roles/output IDs are in assets/GENERATION.md; provenance, framing and limitations are in assets/PROVENANCE.md and DIRECTION.md. Native and built-in generation outputs are all retained within root assets/.
- vite.config.ts copies only runtime brand/product/icon/social assets. .gitignore keeps those assets and workflow trackable, while ignoring build output, browser reports/caches, dependencies and Python bytecode. package.json adds preview:pages and verify:pages. Verification scripts check project-path hosting, high-density touch, metadata, image deferral and module failure. README documents release setup; .github/workflows/pages.yml prepares a manual Pages release.

### Actual verification

The final production output was served at http://127.0.0.1:4183/nurture/ by a strict static-file server, without Vite rewrites or SPA fallback. Root type checking and prerendered production build passed. The delivery has 41 files totalling 2,040,535 bytes; generation/reference PNGs and wordmark tooling are excluded. All 18 product delivery hashes match root sources, and 30 prerendered asset references resolve. The source/build/regeneration dependency scan finds no archive dependency.

Chrome production checks passed at 320, 390, 820, 1440 and 1920px: full content, no horizontal overflow or broken visible images, reversible signature, all gallery views, decoded lightbox images, anchors, native FAQ, keyboard focus/traps/Escape/restore, mobile navigation, reduced motion, no-JavaScript rendering, real image failure/recovery and no unexpected HTTP/JavaScript errors. Axe scans at 1440/390px each recorded 26 passing rules and zero violations. The contrast incomplete item remains in the raw reports; manual calculations for the actual primary/muted/accent text on ivory/oat/stone give 12.89, 6.26, 5.55, 5.06, 5.20 and 4.92:1, all above 4.5:1. These checks do not substitute for a screen-reader or participant study.

Separate DPR 3 touch checks passed at 320×568, 360×800, 390×844 and 430×932, plus 844×390 landscape. They confirm the complete lockup, first-viewport exploration link, primary touch targets at least 44px, high-resolution mobile-source selection, tap inspection/reversal, menu/anchor/home navigation, canonical/sharing URLs and no overflow/errors. Deliberately blocking the application bundle restores native navigation and preserves the prerendered page and FAQ. The portrait and desktop renders and header crop were visually inspected in real browser screenshots.

Edge 154.0.4258.62 and WebKit 27.2 passed at 1440/390px, including decoded modal imagery, keyboard navigation and reduced motion. Development lifecycle diagnostics still return application animations, ScrollTriggers and Lenis tickers to zero on unmount and live reduced motion, clear open dialogs/scroll locks and remount without multiplication. GSAP's single internal refresh callback is reported separately.

### Actual performance measurements

Nine sequential cold-cache headless Chrome loads, three per scenario, against the final Pages-style static server; DPR 1. Throttled mobile: 4× CPU, 1.6 Mbps download, 0.75 Mbps upload, 150ms latency. No other browser suites ran during measurement. Local lab observations only: no Lighthouse score, field data or deployed GitHub Pages timing is claimed.

| Final median | LCP | FCP | CLS | Transfer bytes | Observed long-task blocking |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Desktop 1440×900 | 92ms | 92ms | 0.000132 | 791,460 | 0ms |
| Mobile 390×844 | 88ms | 88ms | 0 | 646,764 | 0ms |
| Throttled mobile | 1,256ms | 1,212ms | 0 | 646,764 | 67ms |

LCP was the hero-angle image in every sample; throttled samples ranged 1,244–1,276ms. Blocking is the sum of observed task duration above 50ms, not Lighthouse TBT. A loading trace identified the mobile no-JavaScript-navigation-to-hydrated-header transition as the major initial shift; the final three throttled samples had CLS 0 after correction. JS is 378,614 bytes / 124,057 gzip; CSS 25,040 / 6,036 gzip; sharing JPEG 53,179 bytes at 1200×630. Reports and screenshots are retained locally in ignored verification/.

### Hosting and remaining limits

The static output is technically compatible with GitHub Pages, including a repository subpath and absolute sharing metadata. The prepared workflow uses official action revisions from Vite's deployment documentation and the Pages action's real base_url output. It runs manually, installs locked dependencies on Node 24, type-checks, builds, verifies asset integrity and deploys only dist/. No workflow was executed remotely and nothing was published. GitHub CLI was unauthenticated, so repository visibility, Pages eligibility and environment/settings were not inspected. After merging to the default branch, choose GitHub Actions under Settings → Pages and manually run the workflow.

Approved product photography/artwork/formula, launch information and any commerce/waitlist service remain future integrations. Generated logo and packaging interpretations may differ slightly from their references. Actual iPhone/Safari hardware, Firefox, screen readers, human usability and deployed-host performance remain untested. The concept disclosure and noindex policy remain in place.

### Candid internal rubric

| Criterion | Internal rating | Assessment |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Design | 8.5/10 | The deliberate lockup and larger phone product improve cohesion; generated artwork and endorsement details still limit exact brand fidelity. |
| Usability | 8.6/10 | Portrait/landscape touch, keyboard, motion alternatives, static content and loading/failure paths are verified. Hardware and assistive-technology study remains open. |
| Creativity | 7/10 | Product inspection supports everyday attention; the experience remains deliberately restrained. |
| Content | 7/10 | Honest concept information and disclosure, with real formulation and sales details still unavailable. |

These are subjective implementation self-assessments, not Awwwards votes, awards or predictions. No submission was performed.

## Scope and concept

Complete light luxury rebuild inside `nurture-redesign/`, using the installed `build-awwwards-quality-sites` skill and compatible editorial direction. The parent website and original source assets were not edited. Phase 0–3 decisions are recorded in DESIGN.md; Phase 4–6 results follow here. No award submission or deployment was performed.

**The everyday, considered.** An ivory editorial product study around the existing cream-and-gold mockup. Exactly one product-led hero interaction, **A closer look**, changes angle to front, gently enlarges the product and exposes two packaging details. It supports repeat reversal, keyboard, touch, instantaneous reduced motion and a complete static fallback.

## Craft and corrections

- Replaced the old green hero, campaign surfaces, orbit decoration, layout and footer. Removed obsolete copied media from this child folder.
- Refined reading hierarchy, large serif composition, local font loading, restrained gold accents, focus indicators, hover feedback, image loading/error states and semantic headings.
- Added a matching favicon, 1200 × 630 sharing image, sourced/attributed SVG arrows and deployment-aware absolute metadata URLs.
- Kept truthful concept disclosures. Corrected a stale FAQ reference to generated campaign images. Unconfirmed commerce/specification/testimonial fields remain unrendered.
- Darkened muted text from #726154 to #69594d after checking stone-surface contrast. Darkened section numbers to #80633f. Calculated contrast: muted on stone 5.06:1, oat 5.36:1, ivory 6.26:1; section numbers on ivory 5.20:1; primary button text 12.89:1; inspection hover 4.92:1.
- Corrected desktop anchor alignment using the actual destination coordinate and reading offset. Mobile uses native scroll.
- Edge testing found focus could escape a native dialog after the last control. Added shared explicit Tab wrapping to gallery and mobile navigation; reran successfully in Edge and WebKit.

## Actual checks

`npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` passed. Build includes SSR prerendering of the full page; the production bundle does not include the development diagnostic API.

Production browser suite passed at 320, 390, 820, 1440 and 1920px, with no horizontal overflow, broken images, JavaScript errors or unexpected HTTP errors. Tested the reversible hero interaction, all four gallery views, enlargement, arrow keys, Escape, focus restoration, desktop anchors, back to top, mobile navigation, scroll unlocking, FAQ pointer/keyboard operation, visible first-tab skip link, reduced motion, and a simulated image failure followed by recovery. No-JavaScript tests passed for page content, navigation, image links and native FAQ.

Independent cross-browser checks passed in Microsoft Edge 154.0.4258.62 and Playwright WebKit 26.5 at 1440 and 390px. WebKit on Windows is engine coverage, not a physical iPhone/Safari test. Visual inspection covered desktop/mobile captures, the two signature states, material studies, gallery, development section, full page and social image.

Axe WCAG 2 A/AA and 2.1 AA scans: desktop and mobile each returned 26 passing rules, zero violations, and a color-contrast item requiring review. The main reading tokens were checked numerically above. This does not establish complete WCAG conformance; image/complex-background contrast, human usability and assistive-technology testing remain outside the automated check.

Chromium development lifecycle check under React StrictMode:

| State | Page animations | Scroll triggers | Lenis tickers | Scroll lock / open dialogs |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Mounted | 13 | 9 | 1 | None |
| Unmounted with dialog open | 0 | 0 | 0 | Cleared / 0 |
| Remounted | 13 | 9 | 1 | None |
| Live reduced-motion change | 0 | 0 | 0 | None |

GSAP retains one internal ScrollTrigger `_refreshAll` delayed callback. It is reported separately as `libraryRefreshCalls` and excluded from page-animation counts. Remounting does not multiply it. The check verifies application resources rather than claiming the library globally disappears.

## Performance measurements

Nine sequential cold-cache headless Chrome loads: three per scenario; production Vite preview on localhost; device pixel ratio 1. Network cache disabled. Mobile throttle: 4× CPU, 1.6 Mbps download, 0.75 Mbps upload, 150ms latency. These are browser lab timings, not Lighthouse scores, deployed-host measurements or field Core Web Vitals. The preview's transferred scripts are uncompressed.

| Median of 3 loads | LCP | FCP | CLS | Transferred bytes | Long-task blocking time* |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Desktop 1440 × 900 | 88ms | 88ms | 0.00033 | 636,943 | 0ms |
| Mobile 390 × 844 | 84ms | 84ms | 0 | 580,131 | 0ms |
| Throttled mobile | 1,860ms | 1,064ms | 0.04409 | 580,131 | 72ms |

*Sum of observed task duration exceeding 50ms during the capture window; this is not a Lighthouse TBT score. LCP was the hero-angle image in every sample. Individual desktop LCP varied from 80–276ms, local mobile 84–92ms, throttled mobile 1,848–1,864ms. All three throttled samples showed the same small layout shift; font swapping remains a possible refinement and has not been isolated as its cause.

Actual artifact sizes, measured with Node gzip: JavaScript 376,507 bytes / 123,581 gzip; CSS 31,354 / 9,095 gzip. Sharing JPEG 56,908 bytes, 1200 × 630. Full raw samples and conditions are saved in `verification/performance.json`.

## Candid rubric self-assessment

These are subjective internal ratings of this implementation, not invented Awwwards votes, an award prediction or external evaluation.

| Criterion | Internal rating | Assessment |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Design | 8/10 | Cohesive warm palette, editorial hierarchy and product detail composition. Existing CGI label imperfections and limited photographic variety constrain polish. |
| Usability | 8.5/10 | Clear exploration, working keyboard/touch paths, mobile composition, reduced motion, static fallbacks and tested error recovery. No physical-device, screen-reader or participant study yet. |
| Creativity | 7/10 | The product inspection supports the idea of everyday attention without spectacle. It is thoughtful and restrained, not technically groundbreaking. |
| Content | 7/10 | Honest concept narrative and transparent development status. The page cannot yet answer real formulation, suitability, pricing or fulfilment questions. |

No weighted award total is presented. The experience is a complete concept showcase; it is not yet a sales website.

## Remaining integrations and limits

Final approved product information, artwork and real photographs; real inventory/price/checkout and fulfilment policies; an email service with privacy/consent copy if a waitlist is wanted; the confirmed production URL for absolute sharing metadata. Keep noindex during concept development. Actual host performance, Safari/iPhone hardware, Firefox, screen-reader and human usability testing remain unmeasured. The mockup is clearly disclosed throughout and no health outcomes, fabricated reviews, stock state or purchase actions are presented.

## Changed implementation

Page composition and tokens: `src/App.tsx`, `src/styles.css`. Signature: `src/components/Hero.tsx`. Navigation/gallery/dialog handling: `Navigation.tsx`, `ProductGallery.tsx`, `useModal.ts`. Typography/icons: `Typography.tsx`. Motion and diagnostics: `src/useMotion.ts`, `src/main.tsx`. Product/future-launch content: `src/content/product.ts`, `launch.ts`. Metadata/build: `index.html`, `scripts/prerender.mjs`, `package.json` and lockfile. Brand assets: favicon, social preview, attributed arrows and media provenance; obsolete copied media removed. Reproducible verification and capture scripts, JSON results, README and DESIGN documentation complete the delivery.

## Repository migration

At the user's request, the completed showcase was promoted to the repository root and the former root website was moved into `old_website/`. All 127 tracked original files were hash-verified with SHA256 after the move. Historical measurements above belong to the completed showcase before promotion. Generated verification output is now ignored by Git and remains available locally.


Post-migration verification passed: root type checking, prerendered production build, and the full root production-browser suite across 320–1920px, including interactions, keyboard navigation, reduced motion, no-JavaScript rendering and media-error recovery. The archived application's type checking and production build also passed. Ignore-rule checks confirm that generated output is untracked in both projects while source files, assets, lockfiles and .env.example remain trackable.

## Regenerated asset edition — current verification

The site now has a single repository-root assets/ library. Seven product images were freshly generated with the built-in image_gen tool from the supplied packaging mockup. The actual prompts, selected output IDs and input roles are in assets/GENERATION.md; sources/licenses are in assets/PROVENANCE.md. There are fourteen responsive WebP deliveries, freshly regenerated sharing artwork, original brand encodings, local fonts/licenses, Solar icons and favicon. Original identity marks and typefaces are preserved rather than replaced with generated substitutes.

Removed the root public/ and src/media/ copies and every root regeneration dependency on the archived application. The new finish and artwork images have dedicated compositions; CSS preserves their portrait frames instead of cropping generic catalog renders. The vision now uses a complete product still life instead of the old enlarged lid crop. The hero's matching front/angle pair retains the same signature, with visible rotation and reduced-motion/static alternatives. Generation masters and original reference files are excluded from deployment. Font license notices and icon attribution are deployed.

A real archive-independence check temporarily moved old_website out of its expected path, then successfully ran assets:prepare, type checking, production build, asset integrity and the full production-browser suite. The archive was restored in a finally block. All fourteen source/delivery image hashes match. Twenty-nine HTML asset references resolve to built files. No source/runtime/build/regeneration archive dependency was found. Authored assets remain trackable; caches, builds and local verification outputs are ignored.

The five layout sizes, keyboard navigation, gallery, inspection, native FAQ, no-JavaScript page, live reduced motion, media failure/recovery and HTTP/JavaScript error checks all passed with the new set. Edge 154.0.4258.62 and WebKit 27.2 passed at 1440 and 390px. Development unmount/remount diagnostics still return to zero page animations, scroll triggers, Lenis tickers and dialog locks. Desktop/mobile Axe scans each report 26 passing rules, zero violations and a contrast item requiring manual review. Actual device/Safari and screen-reader tests remain outside these checks.

The sharing-image renderer initially fell back to system fonts because its document had no matching origin. It now renders from a same-origin intercepted document and explicitly verifies both custom fonts before saving. The final image was visually inspected with the correct Cormorant/Manrope pairing.

Fresh performance measurements after regeneration (nine sequential cold-cache headless Chrome production loads; three per scenario; 4× CPU, 1.6 Mbps download, 0.75 Mbps upload, 150ms latency for the throttled scenario):

| Current median | LCP | FCP | CLS | Transfer bytes | Observed long-task blocking |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Desktop 1440 × 900 | 152ms | 152ms | 0.000197 | 618,561 | 4ms |
| Mobile 390 × 844 | 112ms | 112ms | 0 | 528,995 | 0ms |
| Throttled mobile | 2,040ms | 976ms | 0.04409 | 528,995 | 78ms |

These remain local lab observations, not Lighthouse scores or field metrics. LCP was the angle product image in every sample. Initial mobile transfer is 51,136 bytes (8.8%) lower than the previous edition. No claim is made that every timing improved. Current JS is 377,741 bytes / 123,840 gzip; CSS 23,994 / 5,819 gzip; sharing JPEG 52,410 bytes at 1200 × 630. Individual samples and conditions are retained locally in verification/performance.json.

Current subjective rubric assessment: Design 8.3/10, Usability 8.5/10, Creativity 7/10, Content 7/10. More legible product artwork and purposeful framing improve visual cohesion. Generated interpretations still have small label/illustration differences, and physical dimensions and final manufactured materials remain unapproved. These are internal judgments, not award scores. Final product photography, approved artwork/formula and launch integrations remain future work. No submission or deployment was performed.
